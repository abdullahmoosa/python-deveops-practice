[![Python application test with Github Actions](https://github.com/abdullahmoosa/python-deveops-practice/actions/workflows/deveops.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/abdullahmoosa/python-deveops-practice/actions/workflows/deveops.yml)


1. Create a Virtual Environment 'python3 - m venv ~/.venv' or 'virtualenv ~/.venv'
2. src the virtual environment inside bash so that each time new terminal is opened the virtual environment is activated.
3. Create empty files : 'Makefile', 'requirements.txt', 'main.py', 'Dockerfile', 'mylib/__init__.py'.
4. Makefile can separate parts of your software and help your project to structure and create in a structured way. You can run specific part of your project. 
5. pylint - for better coding practice,
black - for code formatting
6. In requirements.txt you should only specify the modules you need and their version numbers. Other internal modules will be downloaded by python when satisfying the criteria mentioned.
